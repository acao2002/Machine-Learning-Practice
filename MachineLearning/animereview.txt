Totally a masterpiece, no matter how many time you see the serie is totally enjoynable.
The Character developer is amazing especially of the parasytes,the animation is very good, the OP is one of my favorites and the ED is very good too.
The Gore part does not go to unnecessary lengths, but remained shocking.
In addition to having the message that humans are a specimen that self-destructs imposing its own ideals, passing over the other specimens.
My favorite character was Migi,over time he understands Shinichi's feelings, but even keeping his own personality as "parasyte",also Shinichi understands the Migi's thoughts about humanity
Totally recommend this series
