Pet girl of Sakurasou is not your standard romcom, now it does have generic romcom cliches, and no romantic progression among characters until final episodes, but it makes up for it with its amazing emotional scenes, and real life premise of coping with failure after trying and trying again, this show takes the saying try and try again until you suceed, and shows you reality that talent overcomes hardwork, since no matter how hard some people try they will always fail, and that is simply just how cruel life is. I went into this anime expecting it to be a generic romcom, but I ended up being touched by the amazing emotional scenes, and the characters that did not remain papercardboards throughout the story, they actually got some development, at the end of the day I really enjoyed this anime. It tells the story of Kanda Sorata, a second year high school student who got expelled from the student dorms due to sneaking a pet in, he is forced to move into Sakurasou a dorm for weirdos and problem children, at first it seems like he doesn't fit in at all, and he wants to leave, but everything changes when Shiina Mashiro a extremely talented young painter from England moves in the dorm to become a manga artist.
